# NeuralNet
Create any number of layers of feed-forward neural network (MLPs) easily.

# TO GET IT WORKING
  ## Download or clone the project.
  ## Use 'data_loader.py' to load dataset.
  ## Change the values as required for loading data in 'data_loader.py'. See the file for more info.
 
  -- Now in 'model.py' just specify [no. neurons, activation function to use, dropout] for each layer you create.

## This will create a neural network with any no. of layers as you want.
## Change the parameter and hyper-parameters as required.
## Run the script and see accuracy as training progresses.
