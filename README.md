# NeuralNet
Creates any number of layers of feed-forward neural network (MLPs) easily.

# TO GET IT WORKING
- Download or clone the project.
- Use 'data_loader.py' to load dataset.
- Change the values as required for loading data in 'data_loader.py'. See the file for more info.
 
- Now in 'model.py' just specify [no. neurons, activation function to use, dropout] for each layer you create.

#### This will create a neural network with any no. of layers as you specify.
#### Change hyper-parameters as required.
#### Run the script; accuracy can be monitored as the training progresses.
